# Cascade

Cascade is a framework for building agentic workflows. We aim to provide end-to-end tooling for building and running agentic workflows that can be deployed anywhere that can run Node.js, while also providing end-to-end type safety.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This package is not yet published to npm, so you'll need to install it from GitHub.

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several packages and apps:

- `packages/core`: The core package that contains the core logic for Cascade. This is what you'll import from.

Moving forward, we plan to host the marketing and documentation website code in this same repository inside of the `apps/` directory. Currently, those are just the standard Turborepo boilerplates.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Cascade on an informal basis!
